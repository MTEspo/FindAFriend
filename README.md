# Find-A-Friend
This was my first website made as a project for a class I took on web development. 
The link is https://users.encs.concordia.ca/~ma_espo/FindAFriend1/ .
Users can create an account or login if they already have one, then they can browse the different cats or dogs that the 
website has to offer by filling out a form and seeing which ones go along with their wants, or they can give up their own cats or dogs so others can give them a new home. The website also offers
infromation on how to take care of cats and dogs. The users can also logout when they are done with the site.
